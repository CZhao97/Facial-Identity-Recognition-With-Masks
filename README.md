Introduction
Human facial recognition is a classical task of computer vision and has already had many successful applications in for example, access control, attendance counting, facial security checks, etc. Because of the outbreak of Covid-19, masks have become mandatory for most public areas. This poses challenges for the conventional facial recognition solutions because some important facial features, like the contour profile, nose and mouth are covered under masks. Therefore, we aim to develop a system that achieves facial recognition tasks under mask covering, and we achieved this with a CNN-based deep learning model.
